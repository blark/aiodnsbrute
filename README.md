# Async DNS Brute

A Python 3.5+ tool that uses asyncio to brute force domain names asynchronously.

## Speed

*It's fast.* Benchmarks on small VPS hosts put around 100k DNS resoultions at 1.5-2mins. An amazon M3 box was used to make 1 mil requests in just over 3 minutes. Your mileage may vary. It's probably best to avoid using Google's resolvers if you're purely interested in speed.

**DISCLAIMER**
- Your ISP's and home router's DNS servers probably _suck_. Stick to a VPS with fast resolvers (or set up your own) if you're after speed.
- **WARNING** This tool is capable of sending LARGE amounts of DNS traffic. I am not repsonsible if you DoS someone's DNS servers.

# Installation

    $ pip install aiodnsbrute

## Recommended install

Using a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/#usage) is highly recommended.

[Pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is awesome. It takes care of isolating the app for you. Once you've installed it you can install with:

   $ pix install git+https://github.com/blark/aiodnsbrute.git

## Alternately, you can install the usual way:

    $ git clone https://github.com/blark/aiodnsbrute.git
    $ cd aiodnsbrute
    $ python setup.py install .

## Usage

Get help:

    $ aiodnsbrute --help

    Options:
      -w, --wordlist TEXT           Wordlist to use for brute force.  [default:
                                    /Users/blark/src/aiodnsbrute-dev/aiodnsbrute/w
                                    ordlists/bitquark_20160227_subdomains_popular_
                                    1000]
      -t, --max-tasks INTEGER       Maximum number of tasks to run asynchronosly.
                                    [default: 512]
      -r, --resolver-file FILENAME  A text file containing a list of DNS resolvers
                                    to use, one per line, comments start with #.
                                    Default: None (use system resolvers)
      -v, --verbosity               Increase output verbosity. 0 = off, 1 =
                                    normal, 3 = debug.  [default: 1]
      -o, --output [csv|json|off]   Output results to DOMAIN.csv/json (extension
                                    automatically appended when not using -f).
                                    [default: off]
      -f, --outfile FILENAME        Output filename. Use '-f -' to send file
                                    output to stdout overriding normal output.
      --query / --gethostbyname     DNS lookup type to use. Query (default) should
                                    be faster, but won't return CNAME information.
                                    [default: query]
      --wildcard / --no-wildcard    Detect if a domain wildcard record is present
                                    (i.e. *.example.com).  [default: wildcard]
      --verify / --no-verify        Verify domain name is sane before beginning,
                                    enabled by default  [default: verify]
      --version                     Show the version and exit.
      --help                        Show this message and exit.

### Examples

Run a brute force with some custom options:

    $ aiodnsbrute -w wordlist.txt -vv -t 1024 domain.com

Run a brute force, supppess normal output and send only JSON to stdout:

    $ aiodnbrute -f - -o json domain.com

...for an advanced pattern, use custom resovers and pipe output into the awesome [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

    $ aiodnsbrute -r resolvers.txt -f - -o json google.com | jq '.[] | select(.ip[] | startswith("172."))'

Wildcard detection enabled by default (--no-wildcard turns it off):

    $ aiodnsbrute foo.com

    [*] Brute forcing foo.com with a maximum of 512 concurrent tasks...
    [*] Using recursive DNS with the following servers: ['50.116.53.5', '50.116.58.5', '50.116.61.5']
    [!] Wildcard response detected, ignoring answers containing ['23.23.86.44']
    [*] Wordlist loaded, proceeding with 1000 DNS requests
    [+] www.foo.com                         52.73.176.251, 52.4.225.20
    100%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 1000/1000 [00:05<00:00, 140.18records/s]
    [*] Completed, 1 subdomains found

**NEW** use gethostbyname (detects CNAMEs which can be handy for potential subdomain takeover detection)

    $ aiodnsbrute --gethostbyname domain.com

Supply a list of resolvers from file (ignoring blank lines and starting with #), specify `-r -` to read list from stdin.

    $ aiodnsbrute -r resolvers.txt domain.com

## Thanks

- Wordlists are from [bitquark's](https://github.com/bitquark) [dnspop](https://github.com/bitquark/dnspop) repo (except the 10 mil entry one which I created using his tool).
  - Creds to [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) for pointing me there.
- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) for making CLI apps so easy.
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) powers the pretty progress bar!
- [aiodns](https://github.com/saghul/aiodns) for providing the Python async interface to pycares which makes this all possible!

## Notes

- You might want to do a `ulimit -n` to see how many open files are allowed. You can also increase that number using the same command, i.e. `ulimit -n <2048>`
